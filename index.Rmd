# What is R Markdown?

--

### `r icon::fa_comment(pull = 'left', color = 'grey')` A framework for communication


--

### `r icon::fa_file_code(pull = 'left', color = 'grey')` A document format (`.Rmd`).

Rmarkdown was created about 5 years ago

I had 2 years of experience with SAS when I tried Rmarkdown

I decided it was worth restarting and learning R for Rmarkdown

# Case Study

Suppose we are studying whether ticket class (i.e., first, second, or third class tickets) was associated with survival following the crash of the titanic.

--

We want to write a manuscript with three tables: 

- Table 1: Passenger characteristics

- Table 2: Association of ticket class with death during crash.

- Table 3: Factors associated with death during crash.

--

Recap questions: 

1. What is our main outcome?

2. What is our main exposure?

3. What may act as a confounding effect?

???

age sex siblings spouses children

# Titanic data

```{r, echo = FALSE}

cap_levels <- function(x){
  
  out <- factor(
    x,
    levels = levels(x),
    labels = Hmisc::capitalize(levels(x))
  )
  
  out
  
}

ttnc <- as_tibble(titanic) %>% 
  mutate(
    died = factor(
      survived == 'no',
      levels = c(FALSE, TRUE),
      labels = c("No","Yes")
    )
  ) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.factor, cap_levels) %>% 
  select(died, gender, age, class, sibsp, parch)

datatable(
  ttnc,
  options = list(pageLength = 8, dom = 'tip'),
  colnames = c(
    "Died in crash",
    "Sex at birth",
    "Age, years",
    "Ticket Class",
    "No. siblings / spouses",
    "No. parents / children"

check max/min age and spouses

# Characteristics (part 1)


```{r, warning=FALSE}

ttnc <- ttnc %>% 
  set_variable_labels(
    died = "Died in crash",
    gender = "Sex at birth",
    age = "Age, years",
    class = "Ticket Class",
    sibsp = "No. siblings / spouses",
    parch = "No. parents / children"

How did we do that? 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

ttnc %>% 
  tibble_one(formula = ~ class | died) %>% 
  to_kable(escape = FALSE) %>% 
  kable_styling()

```

- Used the `tibbleOne` package

- Ran four lines of code. 

- Did not use copy

- Did not use paste

Did use knit (the button you press to compile Rmarkdown docs)

---

background-image: url(figs/pipe.png)
background-position: 90% 8%
background-size: 12%

# Under the hood

First, we piped (`%>%`) the `ttnc` data into the next function (`tibble_one`)

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

ttnc %>% #<<
  tibble_one(formula = ~ class | died) %>% 
  to_kable(escape = FALSE) %>% 
  kable_styling()

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

ttnc

```

???

there is also a to_word function for MS

---

background-image: url(figs/tibble.png)
background-position: 90% 8%
background-size: 12%

# Under the hood

along with `ttnc`, we specified a `formula`:

`~ row variables | column variable`

Tip: use all the row variables you want, but just one column variable please


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

ttnc %>% 
  tibble_one(formula = ~ class | died) %>% #<<
  to_kable(escape = FALSE) %>% 
  kable_styling()

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

ttnc %>% 
  tibble_one(formula = ~ class | died) %>% 
  select(-group)

```

---

background-image: url(figs/kableExtra.png)
background-position: 90% 8%
background-size: 12%

# Under the hood

We piped the raw `tibble_one` data into 

- `kable` and then 

- `kable_styling` 

to make it look right.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

ttnc %>% 
  tibble_one(formula = ~ class | died) %>% 
  to_kable(escape = FALSE) %>% #<<
  kable_styling() #<<

```

# Case Study

Suppose we are studying whether ticket class (i.e., first, second, or third class tickets) was associated with survival following the crash of the titanic.

We want to write a manuscript with three tables: 

- (`r icon::fa_check(color = 'green')`) Table 1: Passenger characteristics 

- Table 2: Association of ticket class with death during crash.

- Table 3: Factors associated with death during crash.

**Question:** 

Who do you *hypothesize* will be at the lowest risk for death during the crash?

--

**Answer:**

A reasonable (though incorrect) answer is passengers with first class tickets.

# Under the hood

How did that one work?

- We used the `rpriori` package. 

- Started by Specifying 3 models and a main hypothesis.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

# Make an unadjusted model
m0  <- mspec_empty(name = "Model 0") #<<
# Model 1 includes adjustment for sex and age
m1  <- mspec_add(m0, gender, age, name = "Model 1")
# Model 2 = model 1 + no. of siblings/spouses
m2 <- mspec_add(m1, sibsp, parch, name = 'Model 2')

main_hypothesis <- hypothesize_that(died ~ class)

```

```{r}
m0
```

???

specifications are easily plugged in to analyses

apriori models are almost always nested

Once hypothesis and models are fixed, we attached the model *specifications* to the hypothesis

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

  embed_data(drop_na(ttnc)) %>% 
  embed_fits(engine = 'glm', family = binomial(link = 'logit')) 


```

```{r}
main_hypothesis %>% embed_mspecs(m0, m1, m2)
```

???

Model specifications and hypotheses come first

---

# Under the hood

then we attached the data to the model *specifications*

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

apri <- main_hypothesis %>% 
  embed_mspecs(m0, m1, m2) %>% 
  embed_data(drop_na(ttnc)) %>% #<<

```

```{r}

main_hypothesis %>% 
  embed_mspecs(m0, m1, m2) %>% 
  embed_data(drop_na(ttnc))

```

???

Data comes second

---

# Under the hood

Last, we fit the models.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

apri <- main_hypothesis %>% 
  embed_mspecs(m0, m1, m2) %>% 
  embed_data(drop_na(ttnc)) %>%
  embed_fits(engine = 'glm', family = binomial(link = 'logit')) #<<


```

```{r}

main_hypothesis %>%

  embed_data(drop_na(ttnc)) %>% 
  embed_fits(
    engine = 'glm', 
    family = binomial(link = 'logit')

models last!

apri_fits are special types (light)

# Case Study

**Question:** 

How many models did we need to fit for Table 2?

--

**Question we'll circle back to**

How many models do we need to fit for Table 3?

???

just three

more than three (11)

We could change the code for all 11 of our models, one by one, and then copy and paste the results from the model output, one by one, on top of our first draft.
